## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Alpaca API keys (with paper or live trading access)
- Claude for Desktop or another compatible MCP client

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and move to the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alpaca-mcp-server.git
   cd alpaca-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install mcp alpaca-py python-dotenv
   ```

## Usage (for Paper Trading) with Claude Desktop

### Edit a `.env` file for your credentials in the project directory

   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
   ```

### Start the MCP Server

Open a terminal and run the command below from the project directory:

```bash
python alpaca_mcp_server.py
```

Or use a module invocation:

```bash
python -m alpaca_mcp_server
```

### Claude for Desktop Configuration

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Navigate to: `Settings → Developer → Edit Config`
3. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## API Key Configuration for Live Trading

This MCP server connects to Alpaca's **paper trading API** by default for safe testing.
To enable **live trading with real funds**, update the following configuration files:

### 🔐 Set Your API Credentials in Two Places:

1. **Claude for Desktop Configuration**

   In `claude_desktop_config.json`, provide your keys for your live account as environment variables:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "alpaca": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account",
           "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`.env` in the project directory**

   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
   PAPER = False
   ```
