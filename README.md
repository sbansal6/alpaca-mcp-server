## 0. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- GitHub account
- Alpaca API keys (with paper or live trading access)
- Claude for Desktop or another compatible MCP client

## 1. Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-mcp-server.git
   cd alpaca-mcp-server
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
    **Note:** The virtual environment will use the Python version that was used to create it. If you run the command with Python 3.10 or newer, your virtual environment will also use Python 3.10+. If you want to confirm the version, you can run `python3 --version` after activating the virtual environment. 

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Project Structure

After cloning and activating the virtual environment, your directory structure should look like this:
```
alpaca-mcp-server/          ← This is the workspace folder (= project root)
├── alpaca_mcp_server.py    ← Script is directly in workspace root
├── .vscode/                ← VS Code settings (for VS Code users)
│   └── mcp.json
├── venv/                   ← Virtual environment folder
│   └── bin/python
├── .env.example            ← Environment template (use this to create `.env` file)
├── .gitignore              
├── Dockerfile              ← Docker configuration (for Docker use)
├── .dockerignore           ← Docker ignore (for Docker use)
├── requirements.txt           
└── README.md
```

## 2. Create and edit a .env file for your credentials in the project directory

   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key"
   ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE = True
   TRADE_API_URL = None
   TRDE_API_WSS = None
   DATA_API_URL = None
   STREAM_DATA_WSS = None
   ```

## Claude Desktop Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Claude Desktop, please follow the steps below. The official Claude Desktop setup document is available here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user

### Start the MCP Server

Open a terminal in the project root directory and run the following command (or use `python -m alpaca_mcp_server`):

```bash
python alpaca_mcp_server.py 
```

### Claude for Desktop Configuration

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Navigate to: `Settings → Developer → Edit Config`
3. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

  **Note:**\
    Replace <project_root> with the path to your cloned alpaca-mcp-server directory. This should point to the Python executable inside the virtual environment you created with `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "<project_root>/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/alpaca-mcp-server/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Claude Code, please follow the steps below.

The `claude mcp add command` is part of [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). If you have the Claude MCP CLI tool installed (e.g. by `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`), you can use this command to add the server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add alpaca \
  /path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/venv/bin/python \
  /path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/alpaca_mcp_server.py \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

**Note:** Replace the paths with your actual project directory paths. This command automatically adds the MCP server configuration to Claude Code without manual JSON editing.

The Claude MCP CLI tool needs to be installed separately. Check following the official pages for availability and installation instructions
* [Learn how to set up MCP with Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
* [Install, authenticate, and start using Claude Code on your development machine](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup)

## VS Code Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with VS Code, please follow the steps below.

VS Code supports MCP servers through GitHub Copilot's agent mode.
The official VS Code setup document is available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers

**Prerequisites**
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed and active subscription
- Python 3.10+ and virtual environment set up (follow Installation steps above)
- MCP support enabled in VS Code (see below)

### 1. Enable MCP Support in VS Code

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "chat.mcp.enabled" to check the box to enable MCP support
3. Search for "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp" to check the box to use instruction files

### 2. Configure the MCP Server

**Recommendation:** Use **workspace-specific** configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`) instead of user-wide configuration. This allows different projects to use different API keys (multiple paper accounts or live trading) and keeps trading tools isolated from other development work.

**For workspace-specific settings:**

1. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root.
2. Add the Alpaca MCP server configuration manually to the mcp.json file:
    ```json
    {
      "alpaca": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "${workspaceFolder}/venv/bin/python",
        "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/alpaca_mcp_server.py"],
        "env": {
          "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
          "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key",
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    **Note:** For Windows users, replace the "command" parameter with "${workspaceFolder}\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe"

**For user-wide settings:**

To configure an MCP server for all your workspaces, you can add the server configuration to your user settings.json file. This allows you to reuse the same server configuration across multiple projects.
Specify the server in the `mcp` VS Code user settings (`settings.json`) to enable the MCP server across all workspaces.
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "alpaca": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "${workspaceFolder}/venv/bin/python",
        "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/alpaca_mcp_server.py"],
        "env": {
          "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
          "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Docker, please follow the steps below.

**Prerequisite:**  
You must have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.

### Run the latest published image (recommended for most users)
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key \
  ghcr.io/chand1012/alpaca-mcp-server:latest
```
This pulls and runs the latest published version of the server. Replace `your_alpaca_api_key` and `your_alpaca_secret_key` with your actual keys. If the server exposes a port (e.g., 8080), add `-p 8080:8080` to the command.

### Build and run locally (for development or custom changes)
```bash
docker build -t alpaca-mcp-server .
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key \
  alpaca-mcp-server
```
Use this if you want to run a modified or development version of the server.

### Using with Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "ALPACA_API_KEY",
        "-e", "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY",
        "ghcr.io/chand1012/alpaca-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Environment variables can be set either with `-e` flags or in the `"env"` object, but not both. For Claude Desktop, use the `"env"` object.

**Security Note:**  
Never share your API keys or commit them to public repositories. Be cautious when passing secrets as environment variables, especially in shared or production environments.

**For more advanced Docker usage:**  
See the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

## 🔐 API Key Configuration for Live Trading

This MCP server connects to Alpaca's **paper trading API** by default for safe testing.
To enable **live trading with real funds**, update the following configuration files:

### Set Your API Credentials in Two Places:

1. **Update environment file in the project directory**

  Provide your live account keys as environment variables in the `.env` file:
   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
   ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE = False
   TRADE_API_URL = None
   TRADE_API_WSS = None
   DATA_API_URL = None
   STREAM_DATA_WSS = None
   ```
2. **Update Configuration file**

   For example, when using Claude Desktop, provide your live account keys as environment variables in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "alpaca": {
         "command": "<project_root>/venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account",
           "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
